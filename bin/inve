# Attempts to find the root of a virtual environment by walking the directory
# tree from "$PWD" to "/".  Then, it activates a subshell using the $SHELL
# environment variable.
#
# A side effect of invoking a subshell is that subshells go out of their way to
# set PS1.  You could add something like this to your .bashrc to append virtual
# environment context to your PS1:
#
# function ps1_context {
# 	# For any of these bits of context that exist, display them and append
# 	# a space.

# 		echo -n "${v:+$v }"
